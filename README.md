# My personal TDD boilerplate

I use this when I want to quickly spin up a playground for writing TypeScript and testing it with Vitest.

# Setup

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:danbahrami/tdd-boilerplate-vanilla-ts.git my-new-project
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
cd my-new-project
npm install
```

Run tests:

```bash
npm run test
```
